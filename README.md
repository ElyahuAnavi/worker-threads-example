# Worker Threads Example 🚀

This project demonstrates how to use worker threads in Node.js to perform CPU-intensive tasks in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core processors. It provides a comparison between running tasks with and without worker threads to showcase the performance benefits. 📊

## Features 🌟

- Utilizes Node.js `worker_threads` to parallelize task execution across multiple CPU cores.
- Compares execution times for tasks with and without worker threads.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.

## Getting Started 🛠️

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites 📋

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation 📦

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/worker-threads-example.git
   cd worker-threads-example
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any are added in the future):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Example ▶️

To run the example code and see the performance difference between using worker threads and not using them, execute the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output 📈

- The program will first run the version with worker threads, creating workers equal to the number of CPU cores.
- It will then run the same tasks sequentially without worker threads.
- Execution times for both methods will be displayed in the console.

## How It Works ⚙️

- **Worker Threads**: The code splits the tasks among multiple worker threads, each executing a portion of the tasks in parallel, thereby reducing the overall execution time.
- **Non-Worker Version**: All tasks are executed sequentially on the main thread, which is typically slower for CPU-intensive tasks.
