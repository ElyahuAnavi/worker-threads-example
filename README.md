# Worker Threads Example 🚀

This project demonstrates how to use worker threads in Node.js to perform CPU-intensive tasks in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core processors. It provides a comparison between running tasks with and without worker threads to showcase the performance benefits. 📊

## Features 🌟

- Utilizes Node.js `worker_threads` to parallelize task execution across multiple CPU cores.
- Compares execution times for tasks with and without worker threads.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.
